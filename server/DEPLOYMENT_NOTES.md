# Vercel Serverless Deployment - Optimizations Applied

## Changes Made for Better Serverless Performance

### 1. Connection Caching

- Implemented global connection caching to reuse MongoDB connections across function invocations
- Reduced `maxPoolSize` to 1 for serverless environments
- Added proper connection error handling and cleanup

### 2. Timeout Optimizations

- Reduced `serverSelectionTimeoutMS` to 5000ms for faster failure detection
- Set `socketTimeoutMS` to 45000ms to keep connections alive longer than function timeout
- Added database operation timeouts in auth controller

### 3. Better Error Handling

- Added proper HTTP status codes instead of generic responses
- Implemented comprehensive error logging
- Added environment variable validation
- Created detailed health check endpoint

### 4. Mongoose Optimizations

- Disabled mongoose buffering (`bufferCommands: false`)
- Set `bufferMaxEntries: 0`
- Added `family: 4` to use IPv4 only
- Enabled `strictQuery` mode

### 5. Environment Improvements

- Added missing environment variable checks
- Better error messages with development vs production modes
- Enhanced connection state monitoring

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in your Vercel deployment:

```
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
CLIENT_URL=https://your-client-url.vercel.app
NODE_ENV=production
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
COOKIE_DOMAIN=.vercel.app
```

## Testing

1. Deploy to Vercel
2. Check `/health` endpoint to verify database connection
3. Test login functionality
4. Monitor logs for connection issues

## If Issues Persist

If you still experience connection issues after these optimizations:

1. Check MongoDB Atlas network access settings
2. Verify connection string is correct
3. Consider using MongoDB Atlas Data API for fully serverless approach
4. Alternative: Move server to Render/Railway while keeping client on Vercel
